# The base directory that you unzipped the display.zip/display.tgz file into
# MR: basedir is a built-in Ant property

# The default jar file for the Servlet and JSP API classes. You have to provide
# this, I'm assuming you can figure out where it is, otherwise this taglib
# won't be very useful for you.

# The jar file for the Jakarta commons-beanutil.jar library.  This library
# is currently required by this tag library to perform property lookups on
# the objects in the list being displayed.  Down the road we might try to
# remove this dependency, but for now it saved me quite a bit of time...

beanutils.jar=${basedir}/lib/commons-beanutils.jar

# The jar file for the Jakarta commons-collections.jar library.  This library
# is currently required by this tag library because beanutils.jar above makes
# use of it.

collections.jar=${basedir}/lib/commons-collections.jar

# The jar file for the Jakarta log4j.jar library.  This library is currently
# required for logging of debugging messages.  Down the road we might try to
# remove this dependency (or at least make it optional).
#
# The log messages are logged to the "org.jakarta.taglibs.display" category.
# It is up to you to direct that category to go to somewhere useful...
