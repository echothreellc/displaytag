Warning

 This documentation is related to the displaytag 1.1 development. If you are looking for the latest production-quality
displaytag release, 1.0, please go {{{http://displaytag.sourceforge.net}here}}.

 Displaytag 1.1 is a work in progress and it's not considered stable for production use. New APIs and attributes are not
consolidated yet and could likely change before a release.


Overview

 The display tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that provide high-level web presentation patterns which
will work in an MVC model. The library provides a significant amount of functionality while still being easy to use.


What can I do with it?

 Actually the display tag library can just... display tables! Give it a list of objects and it will handle column
display, sorting, paging, cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of a table in a customizable XHTML
style.

 The tables in the sample images below were generated from lists using the <display:table> tag:
