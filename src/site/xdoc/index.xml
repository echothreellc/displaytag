        This documentation is related to the displaytag 1.1 development. If you are looking for the latest
        production-quality displaytag release, 1.0, please go
        <a href="./10/index.html">here</a>
        . Displaytag 1.1 is a work in progress and it's not considered stable for production use. New APIs and
        attributes are not consolidated yet and could likely change before a release.

        The display tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that provide high-level web presentation patterns
        which will work in an MVC model. The library provides a significant amount of functionality while still being
        easy to use.

      <p>
        Actually the display tag library can just... display tables! Give it a list of objects and it will handle column
        display, sorting, paging, cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of a table in a
        customizable XHTML style.
      </p>
      <p>The tables in the sample images below were generated from lists using the &lt;display:table&gt; tag:</p>
