			<question>What jre is needed to run displaytag? Why 0.8.5 version is not working whith jre 1.3?</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Displaytag should work with any jre >= 1.1. The binary distribution for 0.8.5 version, however, was
					erroniously compiled with 1.4 optimization, so it doesn't work with java 1.3 (usually you get a
					blank page or an error saying StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer) doesn't exists). To fix it get the
					source distribution and recompile it using java 1.3

			<question>
			    How do I use this tag with Struts?  The links that it creates for sorts and exports all point back to 
			    the JSP page, not my Action!
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Use the requestURI attribute of the column tag.  When the requestURI attribute is present, 
					links for sorting, exports, and paging are formed by adding any tag generated parameters 
					to the value of requestURI attribute.  
					So if your page is served under <code>/ManageLatin.do</code>,  you should have 
					<code>requestURI="/ManageLatin.do"</code> on your display:table.
