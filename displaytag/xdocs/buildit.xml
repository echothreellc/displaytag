                <p>
					Refer to the
                    <a href="download.html">download</a>
					section for how to download a source release of a snapshot from CVS.

                <p>
					Displaytag uses maven for build and site generation. First of all, you need to download and install
					maven (you will need at least Maven 1.0) from
                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven.apache.org</a>
					. Follow the instructions on the Maven site on how to do this.
                </p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Run it!">
                <p>
					It couldn't be more simple: go to the folder containing the (unzipped) source, type
                    <strong>maven</strong>
					and watch the show. For this you need a working internet connection since maven will first try to
					download all the needed libraries (see
                    <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a>
					) from a remote repository.
                </p>
                <p>
					Running maven without arguments will execute the default goal, which will build the library, the
					sample webapp, and the documentation site (this one). You can run
                    <strong>maven -g</strong>
					to see the available goals. Running
                    <strong>maven jar</strong>
					will simply create the library jar without the sample site and documentation.
                </p>
