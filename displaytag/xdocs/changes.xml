  	<release version="1.0-b3" date="in CVS" description="">
      <action type="add" dev="mraible" due-to="Tim McCune">
        Added Expression Support ala JSTL.  To use it, just specify your taglib URI to be 
        http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/display-el.  As part of this enhancement, I added
        (to the EL taglib only) a "titleKey" and "url" attribute.  The titleKey attribute
        will lookup it's value as a key in a JSTL bundle (declared using the &lt;fmt:bundle 
        tag or in your web.xml).  The url attribute is an enhancement to the "href" attribute
        which prepends the contextPath.

      paging.banner.placement property.

      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Automatic column discovery when no columns are defined. Instead of the simple output with the 
        object toString() and the message "please define column tags", the table tag will automatically add
        columns mapped to object properties. This is especially useful in development to quickly see and 
        test available properties.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">
        The following methods in TableDecorator are now correctly declared as <code>final</code>:
        <code>getViewIndex()</code>, 
        <code>getListIndex()</code>, 
        <code>initRow(Object, int, int)</code>, 
        <code>getCurrentRowObject()</code>. These methods should never be extended in subclasses of
        TableDecorator.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">
        Removed the <code>value</code> property of ColumnTag. This was totally undocumented in previous versions

        User properties can now be loaded from files when deployed in unexploded WAR.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="rapruitt">
        Altered the properties search process. Properties in the file displaytag.properties will now override properties from TableTag.properties. Users
            can add additional properties via the TableProperties#setUserProperties() method.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="rapruitt"> Added media attribute to ColumnTag. Broadened ExportTypeEnum
        to also cover the HTML case; renamed to MediaTypeEnum. Current mediaType exposed via scripting variable 'mediaType'.
        This can be used in column content to generate output based on madia type (don't output html when exporting and so on).
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.0-b1" date="September 22, 2003" description="first beta of the completely rewritten library">
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Mavenized! Thanks to Didier Dubois for the help on migrating the build system to maven.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">
        Totally refactored/rewritten. The whole library has been rewritten, improved package structure, code quality,
        logging and exception handling.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Major addiction: the table tag works now also with an iterator approach, letting you specify content in the
        body of the column tag.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">
        Better html output. The rendered html code is now completely xhtml STRICT compliant. Some of the css classes
        have been changed, check the docs for upgrading from previous versions.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Global configuration with a user supplied properties file (configured in web.xml) which lets you personalize
        most of the tag output.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Link attributes are encoded to let you use more table in the same page with independent paging, sorting and
        exporting. You can also put nested display:table tag!
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Link parameters are preserved in paging/sorting. Paging will always keep the correct order, and it will also
        maintain the correct order/page for all the table displayed.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="fgiust">
        Example site refactored (xhtml strict+css), added new samples.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        It's now possible to define objects/nested attributes with the beanutils style language + scope (ex.
        sessionScope.list.value.attribute(name).item[1] =
        session.getAttribute("list").getValue().getAttribute("name").getItem[1]).
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="fgiust">
        Lots of small changes/addiction:
        <ul>
          <li>renamed attributes "styleClass" to standard "class" ("styleClass" is retained but deprecated)</li>
          <li>added "defaultsort" attribute to specify the default sorted column</li>
        </ul>

        compilation).
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="0.8.5" date="March 23, 2003">

        Allow column elements to be nested inside other tags.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="Luiz-Otavio Zorzella" due-to="Luiz-Otavio Zorzella">
        In decorators, added method getCollection() to allow for Collections, Iterators and Maps to be used as well as
        Lists.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="Luiz-Otavio Zorzella" due-to="Luiz-Otavio Zorzella">
        Original table tag only works with Lists. Now works with Collections, Iterators and Maps as well (though some
        functions, like group totals are not available to these, due to limitations on the structures themselves).
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="ed-hill">
        Added startRow() to the decorator API to allow people to put headers on groupings as well as footers.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="ed-hill">
        Fixed a caching bug in with tables that had multiple pages, the pageNumber is now reset to 1 in the tag object.

    </release>

    <release version="0.8" date="May 25, 2002">

      <action type="add" dev="" due-to="">
        added various properties that can be override that effect the default strings and behaviors of table, here are
        some brief examples of message and behaviors that you can now set, see examples-config.jsp for a complete list
        [!!] basic.show.header - include the header at the top of the table basic.msg.empty_list - string displayed
        when there are no items to show sort.behavior - sort just viewable items, or entire list export.banner -
        message format shown in footer, you can localize export.csv - include CSV export option export.csv.label - name
        of link (localize) export.csv.include_header - include the column titles in the export? export.amount - export
        just the page of data or the complete list export.decorated - decorate the data as it is exported?
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="mraible">
        introduced two new column attributes "maxLength", "maxWords" that will restrict the size of strings being shown
        in a column.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="" due-to="">
        introduced new column attribute "headerStyleClass" that allows you to override the class name used in drawing

      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="jay-paulsen" due-to="Jay Paulsen">
        introduced ColumnDecorators - you can now decorate individual columns, this makes it easier for you to define
        reusable DateFmt, MoneyFmt, etc... decorators rather then developing a customer decorator for each table. Note,
        the decorator interface is still not to my liking, expect changes before this tag gets a 1.0 release.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="mraible">
        fixed a bug, where nulls were *not* being suppressed like they should be in the display, now nulls will only be
        shown if you specify the nulls attribute of the column tag.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="Joachim Martin" due-to="Joachim Martin">
        fixed my web.xml files in the various wars - they were not compliant and Tomcat would barf while deploying them

      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="Joachim Martin" due-to="Joachim Martin">
        fixed bug in example-styles.jsp, was using a variable "page" which is a rarely used standard JSP variable (JRun
        didn't care, Tomcat did), just renamed the variable so that example runs under Tomcat.

      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="" due-to="">
        updated all of the example jsp pages with a link that people can click on to view that pages source. Also
        re-organized the pages so that the example table was always at the top of the page as the first thing you saw, and
        the commentary behind the example followed.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="" due-to="">
        The table tag now properly expects any decorators used to be children of the
