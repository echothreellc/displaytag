          1.0-b3 is out! Check out
          <a href="changes-report.html">changes</a>
          for details about new features and fixed bugs and
          <a href="download.html">download the distribution here</a>
          . This will be the last beta for 1.0, we are moving to rc1 now.
        </p>
        <p> If you want to try the new EL version of the tag library added in b3 please pay attention to the tag 
          reference: the EL version is compatible with the "standard" version for most of the attributes but you have 
          to declare the table source using an EL expression. So if you previously used 
            <code>&lt;display:table name="requestScope.object.property"></code>
          you need to change it to
          <code>&lt;display:table name="${requestScope.object.property}"></code>

      <p>Actually the display tag library can just... display tables! Give it a list of objects and it will handle column display, sorting, paging, cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of the table in a nice and customizable xhtml style.</p>
      <p>This is a sample of tables generated from lists using the &lt;display:table&gt; tag:</p>
