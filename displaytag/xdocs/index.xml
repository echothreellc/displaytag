                The display tag library is an open source suite of custom tags that provide high-level web presentation
                patterns which will work in an MVC model. The library provides a significant amount of functionality
                while still being easy to use.

                    This is the documentation for displaytag 1.0rc2. If the version of displaytag you are using is older
                    or newer than this version, then this is the wrong documentation to be using. Read the version that
                    came with your copy of displaytag.

                Actually the display tag library can just... display tables! Give it a list of objects and it will
                handle column display, sorting, paging, cropping, grouping, exporting, smart linking and decoration of a
                table in a customizable XHTML style.
            </p>
            <p>The tables in the sample images below were generated from lists using the &lt;display:table&gt; tag:</p>
            <img src="images/sample_snapshot.png" width="562" height="543"
                alt="sample tables produced with the display:table tag" />
