				As you can see in the <a href="changes-report.html">changelog</a>, many bugs reported in 1.0-b1
				are already fixed. Release 1.0-b2 is coming soon! Uploaded a fresh copy of the documentation,
				take a look at the new tag reference page (and at the new logo!).

				Uploaded a new copy of 1.0-b1 binaries on sourceforge, compiled using jdk 1.3: older jar
        still seemed to have problems on jre 1.3. Compiling under jdk1.4 with a 1.1 jvm target (maven default?) 
        was not enough.

      <subsection name="September 22, 2003">
			<p>
				Version <strong>1.0-b1</strong> has been released! This is the first beta featuring a completely

			<p>
				A complete
				<a href="changes-report.html">changelog</a>

			<p>
				Bugfix version <strong>0.8.6</strong> has been released. This is identical to the 0.8.5 version with
        a fix in the export feature and jre 1.3 compatible binaries.
