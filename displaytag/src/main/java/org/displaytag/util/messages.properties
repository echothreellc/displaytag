DependencyChecker.lang.missing=You do not appear to have the Commons Lang library, version 2.\n\  
Displaytag requires version 2 of this library, and you appear to have a prior version in \n\
your classpath.  You must remove this prior version AND ensure that ONLY version 2 is in \n\
your classpath.\n\
If commons-lang-1.x is in your classpath, be sure to remove it. \n\
Be sure to delete all cached or temporary jar files from your application server; Tomcat \n\
users should be sure to also check the CATALINA_HOME/shared folder; you may need to \n\
restart the server. \n\
