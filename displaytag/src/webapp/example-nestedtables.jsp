<h2><a href="./index.jsp">Examples</a> > Wow, nested tables</h2>


<display:table name="test" id="parent">

  <display:column property="id" />
  <display:column property="status" />
  <display:column property="description" title="Comments" />

  <display:column title="Related address">
  	<display:table name="<%="test.item[" + (parent_rowNum.intValue() -1)+ "].subList"%>" id="child" class="simple sublist">
		<display:column property="name" class="textRed" />
		<display:column property="email" />
	</display:table>
  </display:column>
  
</display:table>



<p>
	In this sample you can see two nested &lt;display:table&gt;. Table tags can be nested to create sublist,
	but you need to consider some limitations:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You can't use page attributes created by the parent table for iteration in the nested table (for example
		if you have a parent table with <code>id="parent"</code> you can't use <code>name="pageScope.parent"</code>
		as source for the nested table).
		The expression is not evaluated during iteration, but only at the end of the whole table (to avoid 
		useless work when you only need to display a part of the list), so you will get "nothing found to 
		display" as a result, since the object created during page iteration is removed before the display. 
		However, you can use objects created by the parent table do compose an expression like 
		in the current sample.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can use the row index to get the object to display from the parent table list like in the current 
		sample only if you are not using sorting at the same time. If you use sorting the result will be wrong, 
		since the original list is not affected by sorting.
	</li>
<ul>
